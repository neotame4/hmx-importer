# hmx-importer
Blender script to import milo/rnd files from most HMX games.

Buggy but very functional importer for HMX games.

Milos decompressed from arkhelper (look up Mackiloha) are recomended to be used.

(To get these, just include -m while extracting the ark)

Games it currently supports:

Frequency

Amplitude

Antigrav

Karaoke Revolution (all of them except KRP Xbox)

GH1

GH2 PS2 + 360

GH80s

PHASE (NOT DONE)

RB1

RB2

TBRB

LRB

GDRB

RB3

DC1

DC2

RBB

DC3

Expect a lot of updates to the repo, as this is a daily project for us.

Also, feel free to submit a issue if one occurs. I'll do my best to fix it.

To make sure the mesh doesn't get distorted when an armature modifier is applied, select the skeleton and go into Pose Mode, and apply the pose as the rest pose.

Then try it again.

And if there's anything you want added, do let us know.

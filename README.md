# hmx-importer
Blender script to import milo/rnd files from most HMX games.

Very beta importer for HMX games.

Only supports milos decompressed from arkhelper (look up Mackiloha)

(To get these, just include -m while extracting the ark)

For GH1, some characters have a parent mesh which holds the transforms. (Usually the head from what I've seen)

To fix the other meshes, select the meshes that dont have right transforms, then select the parent mesh and do Ctrl+P, then "Without Inverse".

Games it currently supports:

Amplitude

EyeToy: AntiGrav

GH1

GH2 PS2 + 360

GH80s

RB1

RB2

TBRB

LRB

GDRB

RB3

Expect a lot of updates to the repo, as this is a daily project for me.

Also, feel free to submit a issue if one occurs. I'll do my best to fix it.

Weights for TBRB/GDRB only work for Wii version.

And if there's any game/platform you want me to add support for, do let me know.
